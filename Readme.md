# Tasklist Example

This project contains a very small and not very good looking example of an Angular Tasklist for C8.
This is the most Frontend Code I've written in the last decade, so everything is pretty clumsy, but APIs can be called and UIs rendered based on formKeys :-)
I hope to make this more sophisticated in the near future, if time permits.
